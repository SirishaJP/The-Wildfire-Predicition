# The-Wildfire-Prediction

## MOTIVATION OF THE PROJECT 

This project is specifically dedicated to indiviuals who are new to the Data Science field and would love to explore by working on independent projects. A simple wildfire analysis, would allow you to understand the basics steps involved in data analysis like, data acquisition, data cleaning, visualization and applying various Machine learning algorithms. 

Any feedback or clarification are welcome. Would love to see more independent analysis using different data sources. Thank you for visiting!
